To run this on your own computer or phone:

1. `git clone https://github.com/appdevumd/bitcamp2023_reactnative.git`
2. `cd bitcamp2023_reactnative`
3. `npm i`

If you have an iOS simulator on your laptop, try running `npx expo start --ios`

Otherwise (or if the above step is giving you errors that you can't fix), 
reference https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup or just google how to 
run a React Native app on your laptop or use Expo to run it on your actual phone.
